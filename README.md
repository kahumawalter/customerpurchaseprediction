# Customer Purchase Prediction 

# Overview

This project involves the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to predict customer purchasing behavior. The primary goal is to provide valuable insights into the dataset through visualization and predictive modeling, which can significantly enhance decision-making processes for businesses.

# Project Workflow

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I performed comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.
Various visualizations were used to illustrate key trends and correlations, such as customer behavior patterns, bounce rates, and revenue generation.

# Predictive Modeling:

Following the EDA, I built two machine learning models: a Random Forest Regressor and a Logistic Regression model.
The objective was to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on their browsing behavior and other available features.
# Model Performance:

The Random Forest Regressor achieved an accuracy score of 0.92, effectively distinguishing between customers who are likely to make a purchase and those who are not.
The Logistic Regression model also performed well, with an accuracy score of 0.90.
Key Insights

The Random Forest Regressor proved to be the more accurate model for this classification problem, offering better performance in identifying purchasing behavior.
Both models provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making processes, such as identifying which customers are likely to convert, enabling targeted marketing strategies, and improving user engagement based on customer behavior.
# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of EDA in understanding the relationships within data and how machine learning models can be utilized to predict customer actions. The insights gained from this analysis and the predictions made by the models can help businesses optimize their strategies to increase conversions and improve customer engagement.
